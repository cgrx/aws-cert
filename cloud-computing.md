# Cloud Computing

1. In a web service context :
	- A client is a website that will be requesting for the information by making requests.
	- A server will respond to client requests by processing them. A server will typically consist of the following : Compute, RAM, Storage, Database. 
	- Client and the server be designated IP addresses, and will communicate over the network.
	- A network consists of the following : Cables, Routers, Switches.
2. In cloud computing, a vendor delivers specified compute, storage, applications, and IT resources on your demand. The billing will be on a pay-as-go basis.
3. Characteristics :
	- On-demand self-service : Promotes flexibility (change resource types), and agility (rapid prototyping).
	- Broad network access : Provides building blocks for high availability.
	- Multi-tenancy, and resource pooling : Makes the service cost effective, and provides building blocks for fault-tolerance.
	- Rapid elasticity, and scalability : Makes horizontal (make nodes stronger) or vertical (add more nodes) scaling on-demand possible.
	- Measured service : Pay as you go for the services (i.e.) we have converted the `Capital Expenditure` to `Operational Expenditure`. This reduces the `total cost of ownership`.
5. Models :
	- Private : Cloud computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. Services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network by the vendor.
	- Public : Owned and operated by a vendor and delivered over the internet.
	- Hybrid : Servers are split between on-premise, and public-cloud. Has the ability to scale on-premises infrastructure to the public cloud to handle any overflow.
6. Sharing of responsibility between customer and vendor :
	- On-premises : 
		+ Managed by you : Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Network
	- Infrastructure as A Service (IaaS) :
		+ Managed by you : Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S
		+ Managed by vendor : Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Network
	- Platform as A Service (PaaS) :
		+ Managed by you : Applications, Data
		+ Managed by vendor : Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Network
	- Software as A Service (SaaS) :
		+ Managed by vendor : Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Network
7. The customer is responsible for the security of components in cloud, and the vendor is responsible for the security of cloud.
